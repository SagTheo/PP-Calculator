        <p>Sport is part of my life. Doing physical activity, whatever it may be, is to me essential for 
            anyone who aims to feel good, in their body as well as in their head. The sport we will talk 
            about here is called calisthenics, which is bodyweight training. Calisthenics have allowed me 
            to achieve a state of mental and physical wellness that no other activity could have, and 
            that is precisely the reason why I wish to share my knowledge to help you gain those same benefits.
        </p> 
        <p class="bg-warning rounded p-2"><b>The information presented here is based on my personal experience, 
            after years of experimentation and regular pratice. I insist on the fact that it should not be considered as 
            exact science. It is merely a guide for those who whish to get/get back in shape.
        </b></p>  
        <p>That is the reason why the content you will have access to here was organised simply and efficiently, 
            goal being that you can start applying it right away. A section dedicated to nutrition and another to 
            rest were included, because even a great training plan, without the proper rest and nutrition, will not 
            produce the desired results. You will also find other sections more training-focused. 
        </p>
        <p>To finish with this introduction, this site aims to help you structure your training, but also 
            to give you the tools to improve your health as a whole. Implement incremental changes to your 
            lifestyle using this guide, as a way to guarantee their positive effects in the long run and create new 
            good habits.
        </p>
        <p class="bg-warning rounded p-2"><b>As mentionned earlier, this is a guide, therefore it is entirely possible 
            for you to adapt it to your own personal goals and schedule.
        </b></p>
        <p>Happy reading and training!</p>
