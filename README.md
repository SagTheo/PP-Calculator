# PP-Calculator

This project is about coding and styling a calculator
Goal here is to practice logical thinking and JS

To-do:

-sort out how to handle decimals
-handle the fact that user can click on an operator more than once (will be added to array calculation and create a bug)
-make delete button functional
-handle really big numbers
-display characters on the screen as the user clicks on them


Difficulties encountered:
    -turn the operator selected by the user from a string to an actual operator, in order to make the calculation
        -sorted out: used an array to store the operands and the operator, then a switch case 
                     to determine the operation that needs to be done
