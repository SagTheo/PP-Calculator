        <p>After training and nutrition, rest comes as the third pillar of any good training program. 
            Working out is what will trigger a response from the organism, nutrition will give it the tools, and 
            rest will allow for this whole process to take place. You don't become stronger, faster, more powerful, 
            you don't build muscle during the workout itself. All of that happens when you let your muscles recover.
        </p>  
        <p>It is crucial to keep this concept in mind because someone very motivated or impatient to see results 
            will often tend to do too much, hoping to accelerate gains. That does not work here. 
            We stress the muscles, they get repaired, come back stronger, and we repeat this pattern for long enough 
            to actually make results happen.
        </p>  
        <p>It is all about perseverance and patience. Trying to take shortcuts will almost always 
            lead to slow progress, frustration, a declining motivation or even giving up, and to top 
            it all up, injuries. Having said that, do not disregard rest. Better, a proper recovery 
            should be a priority, because its benefits go beyond the scope of working out (better focus, 
            more efficient generally, better control over emotions, healthier joints and the list goes on).
        </p>  
        <p><u>Here is some advice on how to optimise recovery:</u>  <br> <br>
            -Try, as much as possible, to get 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night. Even though this may 
            vary for each individual, this range works well for many. <br> <br>
            -Train the same muscle group 2 to 3 times a week(the programs offered here are planned for 
            that frequency). <br> <br>
            -Avoid training sore muscles. DOMS(delayed onset muscle soreness) are a sign that the muscle is 
            recovering, and stressing it even more could prevent that recovery or even cause an injury. <br> <br>
            -Give your body all the good nutrients it needs. <br> <br>
            -Don't forget to work on your flexibility and mobility(see dedicated section). Flexible muscles 
            and mobile joints recover better. <br> <br>
            -Listen to your body. If you feel like you need an extra day or two, take them. If a movement 
            causes unusual pain, stop, work on the technique or even choose another exercise. Being strong and in shape 
            is a good thing, but it is even better if it lasts a lifetime, and only a proper recovery that matches 
            the intensity of your training will get you there.
